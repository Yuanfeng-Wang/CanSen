==================================
Welcome to CanSen's documentation!
==================================

`CanSen`_ is a Python script that provides a SENKIN-like wrapper around
the open-source `Cantera`_ package. The motivation for this project
is to ease the transition from SENKIN to using Cantera. Many 
researchers have knowledge of how to build SENKIN input files, and
many may have SENKIN input files available that they use. CanSen
enables the use of SENKIN-formatted input files with Cantera.

CanSen is written in Python 3. Future versions will try to incorporate
support for all of the versions of Python that Cantera supports. 

CanSen is hosted at `GitHub <CanSen_>`_, if you are interested in the 
source code and development. Please report any bugs there.
